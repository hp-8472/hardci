"""Example: temperature-sensor diagnosis loop driven by the HardCI pytest plugin.

Run from a checkout of the hardci repository (or copy this file together with
examples/adapters/sim_ntc_adapter.py into your firmware project) with a
.hardci/config.yaml whose adapters section points at the simulator, as shown
in examples/adapters/README.md:

    pip install hardci
    pytest test_ntc_diagnosis.py

The `hardci` fixture skips these tests when no HardCI configuration file
exists, so the suite stays green in code-only environments, and it stops
adapter sessions after each test so fault state cannot leak between tests.

These tests only exercise the stimulus side: they assert what the adapter
presents to the device under test. In a real project each fault injection is
paired with assertions on the firmware's reaction, e.g. its diagnosis output
read via com_read.
