# Security Design

HardCI is a local MCP stdio server for agent-driven embedded hardware workflows. Its security design focuses on keeping host and hardware actions explicit, narrow, configured, and auditable.

## Threat Model

HardCI assumes an agent can request hardware actions, but should not receive arbitrary host shell access, arbitrary debugger access, or unrestricted device access through HardCI. The project-local `.hardci/config.yaml` file is the authority for target configuration, artifact roots, named COM ports, CAN buses, test adapters, and permissions. Whoever can edit that file controls the gate — protect it like CI configuration.

The primary risks are:

- Arbitrary command execution through debugger, COM-port, CAN, or adapter-bridge escape hatches.
- Flashing unintended firmware artifacts or files outside approved project roots.
- Performing destructive hardware actions such as mass erase without an explicit safe policy.
- Driving stimulus channels or fault states that the project policy did not allow.
- Confusing MCP JSON-RPC control output with plain serial text output.
- Leaking host paths, serial logs, hardware identifiers, or local configuration details in reports.

## Mitigations

- MCP tools expose named, high-level actions — probe, flash, reset, report retrieval, configured COM/CAN sessions, and configured test-adapter actions — instead of a raw debugger shell or direct host device access.
- Firmware artifacts must be under configured artifact roots, match configured extensions, and pass format plausibility checks before flashing or upload resolution; path traversal is rejected.
- Uploaded artifacts are size-limited and identified with SHA-256 metadata.
- COM, CAN, and adapter access use configured `port_id`/`bus_id`/`adapter_id` values. HardCI never opens host devices or executables from agent-provided paths.
- Test-adapter channel and fault names are explicit allowlists validated before any request reaches the adapter bridge.
- Serial/CAN writes are size-capped; reads are buffer-capped; debugger calls run with timeouts and with OpenOCD's TCP servers disabled.
- Flashing is refused while `allow_raw_debugger_commands` or `allow_mass_erase` is enabled — validated flashing and unrestricted debugger access are mutually exclusive policies.
- `mcp-stdio` is reserved for JSON-RPC. Plain serial text uses the separate `com-stdio` path only when explicitly requested.
- Reports and structured errors include `ok`, `error_type`, `backend_error_type`, `summary`, `likely_causes`, `report_path`, and `log_path` so failures can be audited without bypassing policy.

## Cryptography Scope

HardCI does not implement authentication, password storage, encryption protocols, key agreement, or custom cryptographic primitives. It uses the Python standard library (`hashlib`) for SHA-256 artifact metadata. Release integrity is handled by PyPI delivery over HTTPS, GitHub Actions OIDC trusted publishing, and GitHub artifact attestations.

## Secure Development Practices

The project uses type-annotated Python with schema-validated configuration, pytest end-to-end tests against fake debugger/bridge fixtures, ruff linting in CI, a 3-OS × 4-Python-version CI matrix, and Dependabot for dependency monitoring. Major behavior changes should include or update automated tests and preserve the configured safety boundaries documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `SECURITY.md`. Policy bypasses are treated as vulnerabilities — see `SECURITY.md` for reporting.
