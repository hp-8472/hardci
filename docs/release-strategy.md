# Release Strategy

HardCI publishes through PyPI and GitHub Releases. GitHub Releases trigger publishing and carry release notes; PyPI is the canonical installation channel (`uvx hardci`, `uv tool install hardci`, `pipx install hardci`).

Do not cut the next release for metadata-only or README-only cleanup. Batch hygiene work into the next release that delivers visible user value.

Use small releases while the project stabilizes, but only when each release has a clear user-facing reason. After the early releases, move to monthly or bi-monthly SemVer releases with GitHub auto-generated release notes as the starting point.

## Versioning

Use SemVer for user-visible behavior:

```text
patch  docs, metadata, packaging hygiene, compatible bug fixes
minor  new MCP tools, new supported workflows, compatible config additions
major  breaking CLI, config, MCP, or report schema changes
```

Keep releases small enough that each one has a clear theme and an obvious rollback path.

## Release Notes

Each GitHub Release should include:

```text
what changed
how to install or upgrade
validated workflows
known limitations
links to relevant docs
```

## Distribution Channels

PyPI first. Publishing runs through GitHub Actions trusted publishing with OIDC (`.github/workflows/workflow.yml`) — no long-lived PyPI API tokens. The workflow builds sdist and wheel, validates them with twine, and refuses releases whose tag does not match the `pyproject.toml` version.

Later packaging candidates are Homebrew, Scoop or WinGet, and conda-forge — add them only when they are reproducible and built by CI.

## Release Checklist

Before creating a release:

```text
1. Update pyproject.toml version and CHANGELOG.md together.
2. Run ruff check src tests examples and pytest.
3. Run python -m build (or uv build) and inspect the packaged files.
4. Merge to main and let the CI matrix pass.
5. Create a GitHub Release with a strict SemVer vX.Y.Z tag that exactly matches pyproject.toml.
6. Let the publish workflow validate the tag, build, check, and publish to PyPI.
7. Verify: uvx hardci --version resolves the new version from PyPI.
8. Start from GitHub auto-generated release notes, then edit for clarity.
```

## Repository Protection

Keep `main` protected with required status checks (`Required CI`). Pull requests from agent-driven development are reviewed and approved by the repository owner, so a required approval count of 1 works even with a single human maintainer. Block force pushes and branch deletion. Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed.
